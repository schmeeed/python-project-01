# Background
This is my first project with the NYC Datascience Academy. 

From February '22 - December '22, I collected a dataset of every trip I took in my electric car, 2019 Chevy Bolt using an OBDII device that plugs into a port on my car. I also source data from the EIA for weekly gasoline prices, and my ConEd .pdf utility bills I recieve every month. Combining each of these datasets and using Data Analysis and visualizations, I attempt to address common misunderstandings and myths about driving an EV as well as gain interesting insight into my experience with an electric vehicle over the past year. 

# Notes
- The trips dataset is my prersonal data. I am fine with anyone using it for their personal use, but please credit me appropriately. 
- My utility bills are not included in the files for security purposes, instead I scraped the data needed and wrote it to .csv. I left all of the code in the jupyter notbook commented out if you are interested in how I accomplished that.
